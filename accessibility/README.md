## Technologies and Tools Used
- `HTML5` and `CSS3` for basic development
- `Chrome DevTools` for testing and debugging
- `Axe` Accessibility Checker for accessibility analysis
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Prerequisites
- Recent Web Browser (Chrome, Safari...)
- Text Editor (VSCode, Vi...)
- Internet Access

## Installation and Configuration
1. Clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_front_end.git
```

2. Open the project folder in your text editor
3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd accessibility
```

4. Launch HTML files in your browser to test the functionalities

## Usage
Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate:

- `Tab` to move between interactive elements
- `Enter` to select an element
- Ensure that content is readable and interactive elements are easily identifiable

## Main Features
- Optimized keyboard navigation
- High contrasts for better readability
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards

## Task List
0. **Make the "works" card focus visible**: Enhance focus indicator on "works" cards for better keyboard navigation.
1. **Add the skip-links**: Implement skip links for direct access to main content and navigation.
2. **Elements must have sufficient color contrast**: Adjust element colors to meet accessibility contrast standards.
3. **Documents must have <title> element to aid in navigation**: Include descriptive titles in HTML documents for easier navigation.
4. **<html> element must have a lang attribute**: Set language attribute in HTML for improved text-to-speech.
5. **Images must have alternate text**: Add descriptive alt text to all images for screen reader users.
6. **Form elements must have labels**: Ensure all form fields have associated labels for user clarity.
7. **Links must have discernible text**: Provide clear, descriptive text for all hyperlink elements.
8. **Zooming and scaling must not be disabled**: Enable users to zoom and scale the page for accessibility.
9. **Heading levels should only increase by one and all page content must be contained by landmarks**: Use sequential heading levels for content structure.
10. **Document must have one main landmark**: Define a primary content area with a main landmark.
11. **More than 2 elements become list**: Group related items in lists for better organization and accessibility.
