## Mandatory Tasks

### Task 0. Lexical scoping and welcome message

</summary>

Create a function named `welcome`:

- It takes two arguments: `firstName` (string) and `lastName` (string)
- It contains a variable named `fullName`, that will contains the `firstName` followed by a space and then the `lastName`
- Within the welcome function, write a function named `displayFullName`:
    - It should display an alert with the message `Welcome` + the variable `fullName` + and exclamation mark.
- Call the function `displayFullName` at the end of the function `welcome`

How to test

- Open your web inspector in the tab “Console”
- Copy paste your code
- Run `welcome('Holberton', 'School')`; should prompt an alert with this content: `Welcome Holberton School!`
- `alert(fullName)`, should return a reference error `fullName is not defined`

### Task 1. Closure Scope Chain

</summary>


- Create a variable named `globalVariable` with value `Welcome`
- Create a function `outer` that:
    - alerts the content of the variable `globalVariable`
    - creates a variable named `course` with value `Holberton`
    - creates a function `inner` that:
        - alerts the content of the variable `globalVariable` and `course` (concatenated)
        - creates a variable named `exclamation` with value `!`
        - creates a function `inception` that alerts the content of the variable `globalVariable`, `course`, and `exclamation` (concatenated)
        - calls the function `inception`
    - calls the function `inner`
- Call the function `outer`

Compose the code:

- Write the function `inception` within `inner`
- Write the function `inner` within `outer`
- Call the function `outer` in the main code (outside any function)
- Call the function `inner` within `outer`
- Call the function `inception` within `inner`

Requirements:

- Running the script should display three popups one by one with the text `Welcome`, `Welcome Holberton`, and `Welcome Holberton!`

### Task 2. Closure
</summary>

Write a function named welcomeMessage:

- It accepts one argument fullName (string)
- It should be a closure for an alert displaying Welcome <fullName>

After this function definition, create three variables:

- guillaume contains a call welcomeMessage with Guillaume as argument
- alex contains a call welcomeMessage with Alex as argument
-   fred contains a call welcomeMessage with Fred as argument

How to test:

- In your web console, cop/paste your file
- Executing the following in the console:

      guillaume();
      alex();
      fred();

Should display three alerts like below:

<img src="./Images/wlcm1.png"></img>
<img src="./Images/wlcm2.png"></img>
<img src="./Images/wlcm3.png"></img>

### Task 3. Closure and loops

</summary>

Write a function named createClassRoom:

- It takes into argument `numbersOfStudents` (number)
- Inside, it contains a function `studentSeat`, that takes into argument seat (number) and returns a function that returns the `seat` number
- After the definition of `studentSeat`, create and populate a variable `students` (array)
    - Using a loop from 0 to `numbersOfStudents`, pass the number of iteration + 1 to `studentSeat` and add its return value to the `students` array
- Returns the `students` array
 
Create a closure classRoom, calling `createClassRoom` with 10 students

**Requirements:**

Executing the following code:

    console.log(classRoom[0]());
    console.log(classRoom[3]());
    console.log(classRoom[9]());

- The class gives access to four public methods (return an object):
    - `setName`, it takes into argument `newName`, and set the private variable `name`
    - `rewardStudent`, it calls the method `changeScoreBy` with 1
    - `penalizeStudent`, it calls the method `changeScoreBy` with -1
    - `getScore`, it returns `name: score` (ex: `Harry: 14`)
